## About the Catalog

The tool catalog is fetched from GitHub at runtime and cached locally. It contains definitions for 110+ developer tools with their package manager IDs, categories, tags, and metadata.

The catalog source of truth is the `marketplace/` directory in the klim repository. Individual tool YAML files are assembled into a single `marketplace.yaml` by CI and published to the `marketplace` branch.
